# Cormack-Jolly-Seber model with survival with time-since-marking 
# on survival - converted from trap response model on p.212 of Kery and 
# Schaub. Code on p. 215. There are two survival rates, which correspond
# to the year after the first marking and the rest. 
# The time since marking (TSM) models are described well in Chapter 7
# of the MARK book. Starting around p. 7-40, they describe how the survival
# rates of the first and the rest provide evidence for transients. In the
# sidebar on p. 7-44 explains how the ratio between the two estimated
# survival rates from a TSM model can be used to estimate the proportion of 
# transients (or residents).
