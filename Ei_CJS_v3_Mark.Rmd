title: "Capture recapture analyses for Agnese Mancini"
output: html_notebook
---

October 2020.

This document describes data analysis of Agnese Mancini's data of green turtle capture recapture events. IN this version, we use community (sampling site) specific data for estimating survival/capture probability, and derived abundance using CJS models.

# clean up Mark output files because results are saved in .rds files. Second thought... some results (e.g., c-hat) are not available in RMark output. So, I'll keep them. Second second thought - chat can be computed from overall CJS results (R2ucare) - chi2/df. So, I remove them.
cleanup(ask = F)
```

Of ```r length(community.names)``` communities, only ```r length(community.names.used)``` communities contained had sufficient recaptures. Data for  ```r length(community.names) - length(community.names.used)```  communities were not used in the following analysis.

Not sure what's happening for GNO... NaNs are not good here. I need to look into what happened for the dataset.

OVer dispersion seems to be not a problem. More of underdispersion...

##### TEST3.SR
TEST3.SR asks "of those individuals seen either on or before occasion (i), what proportion were ever seen again?" According to the Book (Mark Book), it states that "If TEST3.SR is rejected, then this suggests that there is a difference in 'survival' among individuals, depending on whether or not they were seen for the first time either on or before occasion (i)." 

```{r}
test3sr.overall <- lapply(test3sr_Cm, 
                         FUN = function(x){out.list <- list(community  = x$community,

                                                            sign_test = unname(x$test.out$test3sr["sign_test"]))
                         return(out.list)})

             digits = 2,

             caption = "Table 3. Results from Test3.sr, which evaluates difference in the expected time of first recapture between the ‘new’ and ‘old’ individuals captured at occasion i and seen again at least once",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

##### TES3.Sm

TEST3.Sm tests the hypothesis that there is no difference in the expected time of first recapture between the ‘new’ and ‘old’ individuals captured at occasion i and seen again at least once. It looks at individuals who were seen again. "Among these individuals seen again, when they were seen again does not depend on whether or not they were seen for the first time at occasion (i)."

```{r test3.sm, echo=F, include=F, cache=T}
test3sm.overall <- lapply(test3sm_Cm,

                                                             p_val = unname(x$test.out$test3sm["p_val"])))


test3sm.overall.df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, test3sm.overall))
```


```{r table_test3sm, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(test3sm.overall.df, 
             digits = 2,

             caption = "Table 3. Results from Test3.sm, which evaluates difference in the expected time of first recapture between the ‘new’ and ‘old’ individuals captured at occasion i and seen again at least once",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

##### TEST2.CT

TEST2.CT tests the hypothesis that "there is no difference in the probability of being recaptured at t+1 between those captured and not captured at occasion t, conditional on presence at both occasions.  

```{r test2ct, echo=F, include=F}
test2ct.overall <- lapply(test2ct_Cm, 
                          FUN = function(x) out.list <- list(community  = x$community, 
                                                             stat =  unname(x$test.out$test2ct["stat"]),
                                                             df =  unname(x$test.out$test2ct["df"]),
                                                             p_val = unname(x$test.out$test2ct["p_val"]),
                                                             sign_test = unname(x$test.out$test2ct["sign_test"])))

```


```{r table_test2ct, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(test2ct.overall.df, 
             digits = 2,
             col.names = c("Community", "stat", "df", 
                           "p val", "signed test"),
             caption = "Table 4. Results from Test2.ct, which evaluates difference in the probability of being recaptured at t+1 between those captured and not captured at occasion t, conditional on presence at both occasions",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

There were four occasions when the test failed at alpha = 0.05; one (22) was positive and three were negative (4, 16, and 18). With alpha = 0.01, only one (16) was rejected. 

##### TEST2.CL

TEST2.CL tests if there is no difference in the expected time of next capture between the individuals captured and not captured at occasion t conditional on presence at both occasions t and t + 2.  

```{r test2cl, echo=F, include=F, warning=F}
# The null hypothesis being tested in TEST2.CL is that there is no difference in
# the expected time of next recapture between the individuals captured and not captured at occasion i
# conditional on presence at both occasions i and i+2. To date, this test has no ‘simple’ interpretation, but
#it is a component test of the overall TEST2 fit statistic.
test2cl.overall <- lapply(test2cl_Cm, 
                          FUN = function(x) out.list <- list(community  = x$community, 
                                                             stat =  unname(x$test.out$test2cl["stat"]),

                                                             p_val = unname(x$test.out$test2cl["p_val"])))


test2cl.overall.df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, test2cl.overall))
```


```{r table_test2cl, echo=F, include=T}
knitr::kable(test2cl.overall.df, 
             digits = 2,
             col.names = c("Community", "Stat", "df", "p val"),
             caption = "Table 5. Results from Test2.cl, which evaluates the expected time of next capture between the individuals captured and not captured at occasion t conditional on presence at both occasions t and t + 2",
             table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```

All tests indicate that all datasets passed the GOF tests. (except GNO, which resulted in some NAs...) - Look into this! 2020-12-10

#### Model comparison

##### BKS

```{r model_comp_BKS, echo=F}
Cm.results <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_RMark_BKS.rds"))

model.table(Cm.results)
```

According to AICc, the best one is Phi(dot)p(time).  

##### BMA

```{r model_comp_BMA, echo=F}
Cm.results <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_RMark_BMA.rds"))

model.table(Cm.results)
```

According to AICc, the best one is Phi(tsm)p(dot). Phi(tsm)p(sum_win), Phi(tsm)p(effort), and Phi(tsm)p(tsm) also were pretty close. First look at the best one and do model averaging later.  

##### GNO

```{r model_comp_GNO, echo=F}
Cm.results <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_RMark_GNO.rds"))

model.table(Cm.results)
```

According to AICc, the best one is Phi(tsm)p(time) but Phi(dot)p(time) was a close second.  

Look at the estimates:
```{r}
Cm.results$Phi.tsm.p.t$results$real
```


##### IES

```{r model_comp_IES, echo=F}
Cm.results <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_RMark_IES.rds"))

model.table(Cm.results)
```

According to AICc, the best one is Phi(tsm)p(time).  


##### LSI

```{r model_comp_LSI, echo=F}
Cm.results <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_RMark_LSI.rds"))

model.table(Cm.results)
```

According to AICc, the best one is Phi(dot)p(time).  


##### MUL

```{r model_comp_MUL, echo=F}
Cm.results <- readRDS(file = paste0("RData/CJS_Cm_RMark_MUL.rds"))
